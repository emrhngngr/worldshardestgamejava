# The World's Hardest Game (Java Remake)

This is a Java-based recreation of the classic *[The World's Hardest Game](https://archive.org/details/the-worlds-hardest-game_202310)*. It was developed entirely by me from scratch as a project for a Java programming course at university.
In addition to recreating the core mechanics, I added several modern features such as:
- A login/register system 
- User registration (via MySQL)
- A leaderboard to track time

## 🎮 Features

- Classic gameplay recreated in Java
- Entity system with collision detection and spawning
- User login & registration system
- Leaderboard to track time
- Clean, structured code following object-oriented principles

## 🧠 Inspirations & Credits

A significant portion of the foundational knowledge for this project comes from [RyiSnow's YouTube playlist: *How to Make a 2D Game in Java*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq). It was incredibly helpful in understanding the basics of:

- Game loop structure
- Reading Resource Files
- Tile-based movement
- Collision detection
- Entity management

Big thanks to [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow) for making such a clear and informative video series available to everyone!

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Java** — core language for the entire game
- **MySQL** — used for storing user accounts and leaderboard data
- **GUI** - Java Swing
- **IDE** - Developed using IntelliJ IDEA

## 📝 Note on Database
The game includes a built-in admin login feature that works without any database setup.

Default Admin Credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: 123

However, if you'd like to use the user registration and leaderboard features, a working MySQL connection is required.

## 🚀 Installation

To run this project, make sure the **Java Swing** plugin is available in your development environment.

### ✅ Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emrhngngr/worldshardestgamejava.git
